# Music

I cannot live without music.

I'd rather become blind than deaf.

And I like almost every type of music, so I won't use the wiki to state everything I like (it would be impossible).
What I'll do is collect here playlists I use for different purposes, and maybe some collections of my favorite artists.

## Music I use to work

I usually switch playlists throughout a job day going through different styles, but these are the playlists that I use for maximum focus:

 - [Synthwave - Retrowave - Retro Electro Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGOa8UIbAc) - sort of hacking music, all instrumental, perfect for coding or playing blitz chess
 - [Hacking music](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJq-O-GkzDUOSQdZPyuqab-PU8rxdfBiL) - for coding without distractions or play slow chess
 - [Old School Metal](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2LTcinqsO68?si=yETwC4iDQJSlNpKgEgLx9A) - for coding while enjoying music
 - [Genesis Radio](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E4kjdOX8rRdZD?si=RvVx-6nfSfqPFUZCrkeNSQ) - for coding while enjoying music
 - [This is Calogero](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6fITX2kSG11?si=G3Ky6aYaRKuGpn_sg9Th2Q) - for coding while enjoying music
 - [Focus Piano](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZIOAPKUdaKS?si=DQF_bhfWSIWzuBOZ2qK0Dg) - to study and sometimes coding
 - [Musica para correr](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3NkIMbepexYBQepmy1S0MQ?si=Ay00Se2kRfKCDSnEzdg2GA) - to play bullet/blitz chess
