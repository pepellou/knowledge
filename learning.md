# Learning

Learning in general is a big topic in my life and it's traversal to everything.

It would be stupid to gather here everything about what I learn because that's the intent of the wiki itself. Instead, I'll focus here in keeping track of courses and other active learning steps I take.

## Courses

### Completed

I have completed many courses in the past, but I'm going to collect only new ones, so as of the time I'm starting this (Jan 2021) this list is empty.
