# Boundaries

This is where my knowledge ends and I want to research more:

 - Review important equations that changed the world: [https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1477628284892372995](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1477628284892372995)
 - Some interesting articles on AI + chess:
   - [Learning to Play the Chess Variant Crazyhouse Above World Champion Level With Deep Neural Networks and Human Data](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.00024/full)
   - [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Crazyhouse](https://ml-research.github.io/papers/czech2019deep.pdf)
   - [Monte-Carlo Graph Search for AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11045)
   - [Writing a Universal Chess Interface (UCI) Client in Java](https://www.andreinc.net/2021/04/22/writing-a-universal-chess-interface-client-in-java)
 - 99 bottles of OOP - I've enjoyed it in the past in their Ruby version, but now they have PHP and Javascript too: [https://sandimetz.com/99bottles](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles)
 - Rust - I keep encountering it but never spent the time to learn more about it
 - React - although I have some experience already I want to dive in, probably take on a serious in-depth course
 - Russian recent history - I stopped studying this topic months ago for no reason, I want to restart on it using this wiki to organize my knowledge
 - Chinese - another thing I stopped studying months ago that I want to restart
 - darklang.com - I want to try it to practice some serverless
 - Currying - I used it in funcional languages but I want to explore it in-depth in JS, [this article](https://dev.to/heytulsiprasad/what-the-heck-is-currying-anyway-p83) could be a good starting point
 - [This article on learning](https://dev.to/scroung720/learning-how-to-learn-diffused-mode-focused-mode-1-433b) mentions some concepts (Feynman technique, 4 memory segments, etc) that I want to explore
 - [This list of free resources for web developers](https://dev.to/arepp23/28-free-resources-for-web-developers-49a3) might include something new and useful for me
 - [This list of 20 problem solving techniques in coding](https://dev.to/codinglanguages/how-to-learn-not-memorize-any-algorithm-or-data-structure-analysis-of-20-problem-solving-techniques-you-must-know-d77) - it might not teach me anything but I want to go over it to review my basic skillset
 - [This list of ReactJS tools](https://dev.to/courseprobe/top-10-reactjs-tools-used-by-the-most-successful-developers-34e3) - I don't know some of them and I want to try them
 - GraphQL vs REST, [maybe this is a good article on that](https://dev.to/blessingartcreator/stop-using-rest-for-apis-53n)
 - [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/?LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-0msrEB3bcHQHiiQD2n_Pzw&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_source=aff-campaign), from the content nothing new but it's always good to review all these things
 - Design patterns in Javascript - I want to explore them in detail, as I'm used to them in pure OO languages. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24GF5MVEEjE&list=PLREW9ZuU80uTfmxo61-acnUYk3P_4plIF) could be a good starting point
 - [How to build a Solana program](https://blog.developerdao.com/buidl-a-solana-program-explained-for-a-web2-dev?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr)
