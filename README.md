# My Knowledge Wiki

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know.

It's obviously impossible to save all my knowledge here but at least I want to save or link most of my "knowledge work" I do (e.g., curated lists, languages flashcards, chess studies, etc)...

## Start here

If this is your first time browsing this wiki, here are some useful corners of it:

 - [To Do](todo.md) - list of things I'm about to add to the wiki soon
 - [Boundaries](boundaries.md) - boundaries of my knowledge / things I want to study/research soon

## Contributing

If you found a mistake anywhere or have any idea to improve this wiki, I would appreciate your feedback.
PRs and [issues](https://github.com/pepellou/knowledge/issues/new) are welcomed.

## Thank you

This wiki is inspired in the work of [Nikita Voloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) on [his own wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge).
If you also find it inspiring, note that you can [support Nikita on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev).

If you find any of my content useful in any way, please consider buying me a coffee so I can spend more time sharing stuff :-)
