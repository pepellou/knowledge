# Chess

Chess is a very important topic in my life, so I expect this part of the wiki to be big. I'll try to keep it organized.

## Topics

So far, this is what I have collected for chess:

 - [My best lichess studies](studies.md) - curated list of my best lichess studies
 - [FAQ](faq.md) - questions that I keep being asked often
 - [Games I played against titled players](titled.md)
