## How to improve

    There's no easy answer to this question, because every player is different,
    with their strengths and weaknesses. But thankfully chess is so wide and complex
    that I think every aspect of it that you decide to work on, you'll get some
    improvement.
    
    That being said, it's usually recommended for players that are not so strong
    yet (let's say under 2000 FIDE ELO), to focus on tactics and endgames.
    
    Again, any other aspect of chess that you might be interested to work on (such as
    openings), as long as you enjoy it, there's nothing wrong about training it, but the
    impact of it in games and results will not be as strong as the case of tactics and
    endgames. Tactics and endgames are the fastest way to increase your
    understanding of the game.
    
    
    --{ How to train tactics? }--------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Puzzles.
    
    Lichess is good enough for that: https://lichess.org/training
    
    Other sites (chess24, chess.com, chesstempo.com, ...) also.
    
    The important thing is to do it often. It's like learning to play an
    instrument or to talk a new language. If you do it on a daily basis, even if
    it's a small amount per day, you'll get to a point where most ideas will come
    naturally to your mind the same way the hand of a pianist predicts the next
    chord in a song without having to think. Daily training, no matter how small
    it is, is how you grow intuition.
    
    
    --{ How to study endgames? }-------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Many endgames you can solve them over the board during a game.
    The problem is that you usually reach the endgame tired, and in a game you
    need to calculate not just one endgame, but all endgames arising from a
    certain position. Also, the endgame is the part of the game that has the more
    direct impact in the result of the game. Also, many endgames tend to repeat.
    
    Because of all that, studying endgames is of vital importance to improve your
    scores.
    
    Anyone can study endgames on their own, because as pointed out, you can
    actually solve most of them without help. They involve few pieces, so you can
    calculate most of it, even long lines. Nowadays we have engines to practice
    playing against and tablebases (on lichess analysis board, for example) which
    can tell you the evaluation and the best moves in a specific endgame position.
    
    There's nothing like working on a position to understand it and learn it.
    
    However, because it's hard to learn things that we ignore that we don't know,
    it's very helpful to have help from other people who already studied. That can
    be in the form of study material (book, video, lichess study, ...) or a person
    (a coach or a chess buddy who can guide you).

## How do you put your picture on your lichess profile

    Host the photo somewhere online (imgur.com or a similar website)
    Then, just put the URL to the image as biography in the lichess profile.

## How can I follow your stream from mobile

    I think there's no way to watch the stream from the lichess mobile app, only
    on the website. From the app, you cannot even see whether I'm streaming or not :-(
    
    If you're interested in watching my stream I recommend you to use either the
    lichess website, or the twitch mobile app if you really want to watch from mobile.
    
    My channel on twitch is: https://www.twitch.tv/pepellou
    
    There's also the discord app for mobile. I announce schedule and updates on my
    discord server so people can know in advance when I'm going to stream
    (although sometimes I go live without being scheduled).
    
    Here is an invite to the discord server: https://discord.gg/2esMbJy

## How can I get my free lesson for subscribing

    As a perk for your amazing support to my twitch channel, I offer you a free chess lesson, as you know.
    
    Please let me know WHEN, WHAT and HOW to do it according to the following:
    
    
    --{ WHEN? }------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    What works best for me is:
    ________> Monday to Thursday from 1pm to 4pm (CET times)
    ________> Friday from 2pm to 4pm (CET times)
    
    Let me know if some of those works for you.
    Out of that, we can try to find too, but more complicated.
    
    
    --{ WHAT? }------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Let me know if you want me to prepare any specific topic for the session.
    
    In general, there's nothing wrong with just meeting and answering your
    questions, but having a concrete topic might help you get more value from it.
    
    Just to inspire you, some typical concrete topics:
    ________> a specific opening or line (Alapin, French, Pirc, ...)
    ________> a specific type of endgame (K + P vs K, Phillidor, bishop vs knight, ...)
    ________> a game analysis
    ________> a specific middlegame strategical theme (bishop pair, second weakness, pawn structures, ...)
    
    Some typical general topics:
    ________> Strategical thinking, how to make plans
    ________> How to study openings
    ________> How to study endgames
    ________> Basic endgames
    ________> Opening principles
    
    
    --{ HOW? }--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    ¿Private or public?
    
    Most people prefer a private lesson, but I have nothing against doing it on
    stream if you prefer.
    
    ¿Tools?
    
    Unless you have a different suggestion, we'll use a lichess study.
    For the voice, let me know if you prefer: discord, skype, zoom or other.

    Hi Pepe,
    
    How about doing it on [ INSERT DATE ]?
    
    It would be nice to focus the session on [ INSERT TOPIC ]
    
    I want it [ public / private ] and we can use [ discord / skype / zoom / other ]

## Can we play a correspondence game

    Thanks for your interest, but I don't really feel comfortable
    playing correspondence chess anymore.

    Feel free to challenge me to another time control any time :-)

## You didn't accept my challenge

    I'm sorry if that made you feel bad :-(
    
    I generally try to accept challenges from everyone, not just friends. But
    sometimes I'm either not taking challenges or seeking for a particular
    time-control/variant.
    
    When I'm streaming, it's easier to reach me because you can see what I'm doing
    and talk to me in the chat.
    
    When I'm not streaming, I spend much time on lichess not playing (i.e. doing
    tactics or studies), but I try to give fast feedback (i.e. reject challenges
    if I cannot play at the moment). If I'm not accepting nor rejecting your challenge
    it's very likely that I didn't realize it's there.

## Can you follow me

    Thanks for reaching, whatever your reason was to do it.
    
    If I'm not following you, it's very likely that you don't meet any of the usual
    aspects that make me follow a lichess user. From the top of my head those would be:
    
    * A chess player I admire
    * A chess player that I have as a reference in a particular opening or variant
    * A chess player that I love or that I have a particular trust relationship with
    * A member of my chess team
    * A student
    
    There might be more cases.
    
    Feel free to introduce yourself so that I really know you and the reasons why
    you think I should follow you.
