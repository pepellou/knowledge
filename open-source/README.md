# Open Source

I'm a believer and defender of [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).

As part of my [yearly goals](goals/README.md) I usually commit myself to keep launching Open Source projects, as well as contributing to others as much as responsibly possible.

In this doc I'll try to keep track of my steps in these milestones.
